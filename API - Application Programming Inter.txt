API - Application Programming Interface
It is basically a communication portal/interface between client and a server
Most commonly used API's are Rest API BECAUSE it is easy to built and maintain

Rest Assured is the most commonly used library for API testing.
Postman tool - Manual API Testing.
Rest Assured - Automation API testing.

Client - UI and Server -  Backend and API - act as the interface between client and the server.
API can send request to the back end through json or xml format
HTTP methods which are commonly used to communicate with Rest API’s are

End points/Base URL: Address where API is hosted on the server

These are the most commonly used HTTP code in Rest API's:
GET, POST, PUT and DELETE -in short form we call it CRUD operators
C - Create - POST/ADD
R - Retrieve - GET
U - Update - PUT
D - Delete - DELETE

GET- The GET method is used to extract information from the given server using a given URI. While using GET request, it should only extract data and should have no other effect on the data. No Payload/Body required

How to send input data in GET?
Ans: Using Query Parameters

POST/ADD- A POST request is used to send data to the server, for example, customer information, file upload, etc. using HTML forms.

How to send input data in POST?
Ans: Using Form Parameters /Body Payload

PUT- Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.

DELETE- Removes all current representations of the target resource given by a URI.

Resources:
Resources represent API/Collection which can be accessed from the Server
In the below examples: Google.com is the end point or base url and maps is the resource.
google.com/maps
google.com/search
google.com/images

There are two types of parameter:

1. Path Parameters:
Path parameters are variable parts of a URL path. They are typically used to point to a specific resource within a collection, such as a user identified by ID. We can also say it is sub resources.

Headers/Cookies:
Headers represent the meta-data associated with the API request and response. In layman terms, we were sending Additional details to API to process our request.
Example : Authorization details

End Point Request URL can be constructed as below:-
